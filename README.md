# TelsDrinks StationAPI for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

Adds some fun drinks into old Minecraft :D

## Description

This mod adds apples as a rare drop from seasonal forest oak leaves and as a super rare drop from normal forest oak leaves.
* Look for the green grass!
* Apples are used to make apple cider and hot cider.

This mod also adds cocoa as a rare drop from rainforest oak leaves.
* Look for ferns on top of really green grass!
* Cocoa is used in the brewing of many of the mods signature drinks <3

Sticks were added as a rare oak leaf drop in other biomes to help signify that the mod is working.
* If the biome is dropping sticks it won't drop apples or cocoa!

### How the mod works:
* Kettles are heated by placing lava, fire, or a lit furnace below them.
* When kettles are heated the hot variant of a drink is given.
* Right click with a mug to take a drink out of a kettle.
* Each kettle has a liquid level meter on the side to show how much is left.
* Drinks can be used to restore hearts, poison your friends, or just be aesthetically pleasing :)
